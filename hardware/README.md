## Hardware
Here are the eagle source files for the OpenWater PCB. It's a very straightforward design. There are no parts on the PCB itself except for a few pull up resistors (which are not technically needed if you rely on the ones from the internal temp/humidity board by Sparkfun). Also, it has two mount holes placed for easy fastening to an enclosure. See 3D files for details.

The gerbers included here are for version 2 since I used Eagle for V2. For the first version I used Upverter. You can find that project here: https://upverter.com/breakpointer/075962a4a041eaf9/OpenWater_v1/
